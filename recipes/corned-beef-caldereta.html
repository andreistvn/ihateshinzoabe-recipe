        Be it a party buffet or just a random dinner, Caldereta has been one of my favorite Filipino dishes.
        You just can't go wrong with a dish that has tender meat, a rich tomato sauce, and a hint of spice. BUT,
        a big BUT, it's so hard to make the beef tender and juicy! Imagine craving Caldereta after a long day, 
        but you still have to wait for hours just to make the beef tender. It kills the mood, namsayin? Like the 
        craving just goes away.

        So, I thought, why not use corned beef? It's already tender and juicy, and it cooks faster than regular beef.
        And thus, the <strong><em>Corned Beef Caldereta</em></strong> was born. It's a quick and easy version of the 
        classic Caldereta, but still packed with flavor. And the best part? You can make it in under 30 minutes! 
        Really a godsend for us who doesn't have the time to wait for hours just to enjoy a good Caldereta. Enough
        with the talk, let's get to the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (340g) Delimondo Corned Beef (<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 medium potato, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth or water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup liver spread (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>Diced melt cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the potato and carrot first for an enhanced flavor and texture then set aside</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, saut√© until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Delimondo Corned Beef, breaking it up with a spoon but not too much so we can still have some chunks</li>
        <li>Add the diced bell pepper, beef broth (or water), and liver spread (if using).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle in the salt and pepper. Stir well to combine.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat, add the diced cheese and cover the pot to let it simmer.</li>
        <li>Once done, serve and enjoy it while still hot because you can only enjoy a good caldereta while it's hot</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Tomato sauce is not used in this recipe because the Delimondo Corned Beef already has a rich flavor and sauce. 
        If you want to add more sauce, you can add more beef broth or water, but be careful not to make it too watery.
