    <h1>Burnt Basque Cheesecake</h1>

    <p> Ever since I learned of its existence, I have been so interested to cheesecakes. 
        Blueberry, Biscoff, even the no bake kinds, I want them all. The only issue I have
        with cheesecakes is that they are pricey as hell, specially the 
        ones with extra toppings and flavors.
    </p>
    <p> So, why not just elevate the classic cheesecake? Maybe turning up the heat and 
        burning it a little? Luckily, we have this thing called the <strong><em>Burnt Basque 
        Cheesecake</em></strong>, which is a cheesecake that is baked at a high temperature, 
        resulting in a burnt top and a creamy inside. I can't think of anything else to add
        here so let's just get to it now.
